# **Coder Cook-Off**

### About

###### This is a React/Storybook front-end group repository created by Anthony Maddox, Hema Omprakash and Naira Reyes for the Software Engineering Immersive Program at General Assembly. This application makes use of our back-end project hosted on heroku. It allows users to view recipes on a home page and search page, and sign up and log in with an external database. The user can also access the recipe database hosted on Heroku with full CRUD functionality.
